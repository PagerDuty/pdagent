# How many seconds to back off events in a service key every time a
# backoff-eligible error occurs.
# The value is a comma-separated list of backoff interval times in seconds.
# The most common backoff error should be that the service is being temporarily
# throttled by the PagerDuty Integrations API.  The first backoff of a service
# key will use the first value, a consecutive backoff error will use the second
# value and so on. If there are not enough values, the last value is reused.
# The default is 180,270,410,610,910,1370 (total time of more than 1hr)
