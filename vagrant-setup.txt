# Vagrant Setup

Vagrant setup notes for OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).


## Installation

1. Install Vagrant.  See instructions at http://www.vagrantup.com/

2. Install Vagrant plugins:

        vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus

        gem install berkshelf
        vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf

3. Install chef cookbooks:

        berks install


## Managing VMs

Run the command `vagrant status` in the project directory to list the VMs
defined in the project's `Vagrantfile`.

For example:

    ~/w/agent$ vagrant status
    Current machine states:

    agent-centos58            running (virtualbox)
    agent-centos64            not created (virtualbox)
    agent-lucid32             not created (virtualbox)
    agent-precise32           not created (virtualbox)

    This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
    above with their current state. For more information about a specific
    VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.


You can bring up all VM at the same time by running `vagrant up` or bring up
an individual VM by specifying it's name. For example:

    ~/w/agent$ vagrant up agent-precise32

**Note**: the first time that you bring up a VM may require a large download of the
"box" that the VM is based on.  The box downloads will be cached in the
directory `~/.vagrant.d/boxes`.

You can manage the VMs using the Vagrant commands: `up`, `halt`, `reload`,
`suspend` and `resume`.


## Accessing the VM

You can ssh into a VM by using `vagrant ssh <machine-name>`. For example:

    ~/w/agent$ vagrant ssh agent-precise32



## Vagrant cache

Vagrant caches VM downloads in `~/.vagrant.d/boxes`.  These are reused when you
destroy and rebuild a VM in the same project or in another project.  You may
want to check for and clean out old downloads here to recover disk space.
