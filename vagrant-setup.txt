# Vagrant Setup

Vagrant setup notes for OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).


## Installation

1. Install Vagrant.  See instructions at http://www.vagrantup.com/


## Managing VMs

Run the command `vagrant status` in the project directory to list the VMs
defined in the project's `Vagrantfile`.

For example:

```
~/w/pdagent$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

agent-minimal-centos65    not created (virtualbox)
agent-minimal-ubuntu1004  running (virtualbox)
agent-minimal-ubuntu1204  running (virtualbox)
agent-minimal-ubuntu1404  running (virtualbox)
agent-minimal-ubuntu1604  running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
```

You can bring up all VM at the same time by running `vagrant up` or bring up
an individual VM by specifying its name. For example:

    ~/w/pdagent$ vagrant up agent-minimal-ubuntu1004

**Note**: the first time that you bring up a VM may require a large download of the
"box" that the VM is based on.  The box downloads will be cached in the
directory `~/.vagrant.d/boxes`.

You can manage the VMs using the Vagrant commands: `up`, `halt`, `reload`,
`suspend` and `resume`.


## Accessing the VM

You can ssh into a VM by using `vagrant ssh <machine-name>`. For example:

    ~/w/pdagent$ vagrant ssh agent-minimal-ubuntu1004


## Deleting VMs

You can delete Vagrant VMs by using the `vagrant destroy` command:

```
~/w/pdagent$ vagrant destroy
Are you sure you want to destroy the 'agent-minimal-ubuntu1204' VM? [y/N] y
[agent-minimal-ubuntu1204] Forcing shutdown of VM...
[agent-minimal-ubuntu1204] Destroying VM and associated drives...
```


## Vagrant cache

Vagrant caches VM downloads in `~/.vagrant.d/boxes`.  These are reused when you
destroy and rebuild a VM in the same project or in another project.  You may
want to check for and clean out old downloads here to recover disk space.
